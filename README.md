# Legal Codes Website by the Pins

Welcome to the Pins team's repository of our legal website. This GitLab repository contains the things we wrote in building the legal codes website in `docs` folder. We use GitLab Pages to generate the whole legal code website with [Mkdocs][mkdocs.com], an Python static site generator.
